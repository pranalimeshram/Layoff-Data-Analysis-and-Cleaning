# Layoff-Data-Analysis-and-Cleaning
This project focuses on analyzing layoff data using SQL, with a primary emphasis on data cleaning, standardization, and preparation for further insights. The SQL script demonstrates techniques for identifying and handling duplicates, managing null values, and refining dataset structure.

## Features
## Data Cleaning:
Removal of duplicate records using ROW_NUMBER and common table expressions (CTEs).
Standardization of date formats to ensure consistency.
Handling of null or blank values across critical columns.

## Data Transformation:
Creation of staging tables for intermediate processing.
Dynamic data partitioning based on attributes like company, location, and industry.
Optional removal of unnecessary columns for a leaner dataset.

## Data Analysis:
Use of window functions to derive insights and clean data iteratively.
Preparation of clean and structured datasets suitable for visualization and reporting.

## Usage
Load your raw layoff data into the database.
Execute the provided SQL script step-by-step to perform cleaning and preparation.
Use the processed dataset for downstream analysis or integration with visualization tools.

## Prerequisites
A SQL-compatible database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server).
Access to a layoff dataset containing columns like company, location, industry, total laid off, percentage laid off, date, stage, country, and funds raised.

## Future Enhancements
Integration with Python scripts for automating the data pipeline.
Adding support for real-time processing with tools like Apache Kafka.
Incorporating advanced analytics like trend prediction and clustering.
